You will need the Irvine32 library which can be found in Irvine.zip here https://github.com/surferkip/asmbook

Extract Irvine.zip to your system's root folder to get it to work, additional instructions can be found below regarding
Irvine along with setting up with Visual Studio 2019/2022 with assembly

VS2019 https://www.asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2019/index.htm
VS2022 https://www.asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2022/index.htm

Windows Security or whatever antivirus software you use can get scared of assembly files and flag them as viruses, you'll have to manually whitelist the file if this happens on your system (I don't recommend turning off your antivirus unless you really know what you're doing)
